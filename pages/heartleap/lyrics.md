## Across The Water

![boots](/static/images/heartleap/boots.jpg "boots"){width="240px"}

Fall into sleep as the sun comes up  
And wake at the back of noon  
Drift through the hours as the sun gets lower  
'Til the days are lit by the moon  

Every day is every day  
Can’t tell one from the other  
Wait to fall at the end of it all  
As stones skip across the water  

Lived on wit, got away with it  
Hummed a universal tune  
Found a thread away in the head  
Followed it over the moon  

Every day is every day  
One foot in front of the other  
Learn to fall with the grace of it all  
As stones skip across the water

## Holy Smoke

![better](/static/images/heartleap/inbetween(better).jpg){width="240px"}

I sigh with every breath I’m breathing  
It’s some kind of holy smoke that I believe  
Will take me on my way  

Some hobo – the dust on my old boots is settling  
And I’m slowly growing roots I said  
Would never tidy me away  

Uhoh, uhoh, uhoh, uhoh  

I do remember what an old friend told me  
He said "don’t you go worrying about me,  
I’m only sad as I want to be"  

Well that’s as maybe, but do I want to be like trees  
Who stand round in freezing fog just waiting  
For the spring to come for me?  

Oh no, oh no, oh no, oh noo

## Mother

![](/static/images/heartleap/Mother 1930 jpeg.jpg){width="240px"}

My mother would dance sometimes  
Believing herself alone  
But through a slightly open door  
I would watch her as she turned  
Turned round, round,  
Briefly unbound  

My mother played and sang sometimes  
Believing herself alone  
But through a slightly open door  
I could see her face upturned  
Songs long learned  
So long untuned  

I was her only audience  
She believed herself alone  
My applause should have been rapturous  
But I closed the door  
And turned, turned away

## Jellyfish

![](/static/images/heartleap/ColdLightofDay copy 2.jpg){width="240px"}

Last night I dreamt that I jumped in the sea  
Wearing a pale blue flouncing dancing dress  
I wanted you to rescue me  
Desperately  
Last night I dreamt that you were looking down  
I twisted and twirled and held my skirt out like a girl  
I could see you frown at me  
Soundlessly.........  

And then I saw that all that you saw  
Was a Portuguese Man of War  
And then I saw that all that you saw  
Was a Portuguese Man of War  

Last night I dreamt that I drowned in the sea  
Wearing your frown and going down  
and down  
and down  
I've come to my senses now  
Hopefully  
hopefully  
hopefully.........

## Shell

![](/static/images/heartleap/corn brooch.jpg){width="240px"}

In the telling of your story  
There is so much that’s lost  
There’s an ocean in between  
The seen and unseen  
That’s as deep as the loss was  
To you so young  
I just see a shell  
  
Can't really get the picture  
I've nothing to compare  
Can't say I understand  
Have no hand to lend  
You had more than your fair share  
For one so young  
But you do it all so well  
  
I fold things just like my mother  
Into two then into three  
I don't know why I do  
But then I think of you  
And what it takes to be free  
From all you've learned  
But you know it all too well  
  
In the telling of your story  
You say there's so much more  
Then you curl away from me  
To some deeper sea  
And I'm here on the foreshore  
'Til your return  
I just see a shell

## The Boy

![](/static/images/heartleap/wildest dreams-softer.jpg){width="240px"}

He sat on the doorstep  
With his arms around his knees  
Watching the passers by  
And wondering why  
They don’t see what he sees  

He watched from the window  
With his hands over his ears  
Listening to all the words  
He’d ever heard  
You don’t hear what he hears  

He stands on your doorstep  
With his life under his feet  
Arms full of roses  
Watchfulness  
He'll be what he will be

## Gunpowder

![](/static/images/heartleap/small dove.jpg){width="240px"}

It seems however hard I try
The words that I let fly out of my mouth
Don’t ever say what I want them to say

It seems that I can never learn my words
Watching them turn around, burning,
Lighting the gunpowder trails that you lay

I blow my chances
And you throw the years out
With all the merry dances
You led me, you led me

I should look for a shed somewhere
Keep my words in the air, padlocked there
For ever and silently out of harm’s way

## Blue Shed

![](/static/images/heartleap/not really here 2.jpg){width="240px"}

I wish I had a blue shed  
With nobody in it  
I wish I had a closed door  
With only me behind it  

Oh but all this wishing  
I might be sorry  
Oh it could be the end of me  

I might emerge to a sunny day  
With everybody gone away  
Into his own blue shed  
Or behind her own closed door  


    Guitar and synths VB


## Here

![](/static/images/heartleap/keepingup2.jpg){width="240px"}

I open my eyes  
And you are there  
With no surprise  
No pain to bear  
I scan the horizon  
For clouds to appear  
I close my eyes  
And you are here

## Heartleap

![](/static/images/heartleap/Hart'sLeap.jpg){width="240px"}

Heart leap, headlong, heartache  
Heartbreak, head down, heartfelt  

Heart melt, headstrong, heart spring  
Heart sing, head gone, heart leap  

Heart sleep, head space, heartsease  
Heart please, headache, heartsearch  

Heart lurch, headfirst, heart long  
Heart song, head done, heart leap  


    Guitar and synths VB
