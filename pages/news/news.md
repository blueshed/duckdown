Culture Now: Vashti Bunyan
22 March 2013
£5 / Free to ICA Members

Join us for a lunchtime talk with singer songwriter Vashti Bunyan,
in conversation with music writer Rob Young.

Vashti Bunyan is a singer songwriter who in 1970 released her first album,
Just Another Diamond Day. The album sold very few copies, and Bunyan,
discouraged, abandoned her musical career. By 2000, her album had acquired
a cult following; it was re-released and Bunyan recorded more songs,
initiating the second phase of her musical career after a gap of thirty years.

Rob Young is a Contributing Editor of The Wire magazine and the author
of Electric Eden: Unearthing Britain’s Visionary Music (Faber and Faber, 2010).
He edited No Regrets: Writings On Scott Walker (Orion, 2012) and is currently
working on an occult history of British film and television.

Fat Cat Nights with the Great Escape
@ Theatre Royal Brighton - Friday 16 - Saturday 17 May 2008

Brighton Festival


Brighton-based label Fat Cat returns for these specially produced
Festival concerts in association with the Great Escape.


Fri Vashti Bunyan, Vetiver, Haushka, Tom Brosseau
Sat Nina Nastasia, The Twilight Sad, Frightened Rabbit, Silje Nes
Heading up Friday night's line-up is British chanteuse Vashti Bunyan, celebrating the recent re-release of her early pop material including her 1965 debut single penned by Jagger and Richards. Plus the lush acoustic textures of Andy Cabic's uber-cool Vetiver; North Dakota's golden-voiced folk-roots troubadour Tom Brosseau; and German composer Haushka, whose disruptive ‘piano interventions' bring to mind the rhythmic sounds of Steve Reich and John Cage.
Saturday night sees New York's cult singer-songwriter Nina Nastasia headlining another dream roster with her spectral Americana and smouldering vocal intensity. Also featuring the skewed anthemic rock of Glasgow's accordion-toting The Twilight Sad; Glasgow's exuberant post-punk Indie rock trio Frightened Rabbit; and the multilayered organic hooks of Norwegian multi-instrumentalist/singer Silje Nes.
Box Office: 08700 606 650 (booking fee)

## Throughout

2004/5 - realising how much of it could be done by VB..  
like all the song-writing  
- and old  
Martin guitar given by son Leif and brought from California.  
It is not  
liking the cold  
but gets  
better with playing.  
And a Danelectro present from Al. Lovely blue.  


## DiCristina
