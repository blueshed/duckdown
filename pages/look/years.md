Just Another Diamond Day re-appears after thirty years.  
Abandoned orphan finds new and different people to listen and like what they  
hear and put it back on road..  
So much more understanding than in its own day..  
all that was never said is said  
and sweeps away silence of years  
and guitar is picked up again

First royalties. Ever. (Apart from statement for &pound;2.4.6d in 1982.)  
Get a Mac they all say, PCs are for offices.  
Got a Mac. And a Roland and a small mixer and a mic and Cubase. Pale blue  
Danelectro from Al.  
Close all the doors and start quietly so no one can hear. First songs  
include &quot;If I Were&quot;

Work and music and delightful days with Max, patient and understanding that  
no musical education does not mean no music in head.  
True to original arrangements and making some completely new ones -  
Max a musical and technical genius.  
All concerned in the making of this album are generous, kind.  
What to call it. Long time, care of family and all, looking back.
