## Lately

never was much given to prayer  
but lately I&rsquo;m pleading with the air  
to keep you safe from harm my dears  

the only things that you should keep in rows  
are your perfect teeth - and the rest you know  
its own sweet way will always go  

add your footsteps to the wear  
for a tiny dent in every stair  
will let them know that you&rsquo;ve been there

## Here before

once I had a child  
he was wilder than moonlight  
he could do it all  
like he&rsquo;d been here before  



once I had a child  
she was smiling like sunshine  
she could see it all  
like she&rsquo;d been here before  




then I had a child  
took his while like northern summer  
and he knows it all  
like he&rsquo;s been here before

## Wayward

didn't want to be the one  
the one who's left behind  
while the other one goes out to life  
and comes back home to find  
me sitting pretty happily  
surrounded by a house  
with cups in all their saucers  
and not a bit of dust  



days going by in clouds of flour and white washing  
life getting lost in a world without end  



I wanted to be the one  
with road dust on my boots  
and a single silver ear-ring  
and a suitcase full of notes  
and a band of wayward children  
with their fathers left behind  
all in their castles in their air  
and houses in their land  



lives getting lost in mending gaps in their fencing  
all I ever wanted was a road without end

## Hidden

hidden in your every move  
are the words that you will never say  
stars and moons are not your style  
I&rsquo;ve known for a while this is not your way  



I hear you  



I do know you very well  
and our time will tell if I read you right  
it can be so very hard  
looking for a dark horse in the night  



I see you  



I do know you very well  
and I will until you can prove me wrong  
maybe I&rsquo;ll find you are not  
anything like what I&rsquo;ve thought all along  



don&rsquo;t think so  



    one day you&rsquo;ll say what you mean  
    and will I be seen for a cloud of dust  
    now I&rsquo;ve nothing left to say  
    and I&rsquo;ll find my way by your light of touch  



I&rsquo;m with you

## Against The Sky

whatever pulled the wind that night  
it had it bring a tree down  
untidy lime tree holding tight  
to the end of my last garden  
one of five against the sky  
an elegant surrender  
it broke the wall and bent the gate  
and warmed us through the winter  



whatever pulls the wind tonight  
will have the roof slates fly  
but rows of chimney pots don&rsquo;t wave  
like trees against the sky  
the hill behind the old house  
I can trace it with my finger  
against the sky I see it still  
and draw it down on paper  



whatever pulled me over here  
you were the main contender  
and with the trees against the sky  
another life&rsquo;s remembered  
some evening skies are yellow  
and over my head they&rsquo;re blue  
what happened to the green between  
it happened to me   
too

## Turning Backs

indifference is the hardest blow  
it is the wind and icy snow  
that falls on green shoots as they grow  
in winter when the spring's too slow  



indifference is the coldest hand  
it is the wave that clears the sand  
of castles built by baby hands  
before the gulls come in to land  



indifference is the hardest ground  
it is the stony silent sound  
of plainsong echoing unfound  
until the voices have left town

## If I were

if I were to go away  
would you follow me  
to the ends of the earth  
to show me what your love is worth  
or would you go and buy a car  
shrug your shoulders say there you are  
she didn&rsquo;t love me anyway  
if she had she would have stayed  




if I were to go away  
would I always look  
for your beautiful face  
in every crowd, every place  
or would I go and buy a hat  
turn my shoulder say that is that  
he didn&rsquo;t love me now it&rsquo;s clear  
if he had he would be here

## Same But Different

I'm in a boat  
on the sea  
and I see  
you on the shore  
so sure  
of yourself  



you're in a boat  
on the sea  
and you see  
me on the shore  
so sure   
of myself  



we're in a boat  
all at sea   
and we see  
we are the same  
the same  
but different

## Brother

isn&rsquo;t it strange  
back here again  
the red brick house and all the trees  
I climbed then  



nothing changed  
same as before  
the only thing I see is you&rsquo;re  
not here now

## Feet of Clay

don&rsquo;t waste this dance on me my love  
step and glide the way you do  
and let me watch the turns and move  
my heart if not my feet with you.  



don&rsquo;t think about me dreaming here  
I will see you fly away  
while in my head you hold me dear  
and whirl me off my feet of clay  



where was I when grace was given  
not to fall when turning round  
I&rsquo;ve no faith in earth or heaven  
not to move my standing ground  



don&rsquo;t waste your life on me my love  
live and breathe the way you do  
no butterfly to be pinned down  
and kept forever through and through.  



but if your love should cross with mine  
I will be here on your side  
as long as you want me to be  
I&rsquo;ll not be going far or wide  



running, walking, standing still,  
sitting, laughing - that I can do  
and wishing, wishing  
it could be me to dance with you
