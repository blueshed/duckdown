## Some Things Just Stick In Your Mind
![Vashti 1965](/static/images/jadd/something.jpg)

(Jagger /Richard 1965 &copy; Mirage Music)

Why does the sky turn grey every night  
Sun rise again in time  
Why do you think of the first love you had  
Somethings just stick in your mind

Why does the rain fall down on the earth  
Why do the clouds keep crying  
Why do you sleep curled up like a child  
Some things just stick in your mind

Why when the children grow up and leave  
Still remember their nursery rhymes  
Why must there be so much hate in their lives  
Some things just stick in their minds


## I Want To Be Alone
![newpaper clipping 1965](/static/images/jadd/bunyan-must-go.jpg)

(Bunyan &copy;Andes Music 1965)

You know there are times when I don't need you  
But you seem to think it means  
Don't love you but I do  
But sometimes I want to be alone  
Somewhere on my own

I don't know why it is but I sometimes feel  
That I have to get away yet I know I love you  
But sometimes I want to be alone  
Somewhere on my own

Don't make me stay to walk aimlessly  
Hand in hand  
Just today set me free  
Let me be alone

Tomorrow I may feel that I can't go through  
Even one more lonely hour  
Without you, yet its true  
That sometimes I have to be alone  
Let me be alone



## Train Song

<span class="lyrictitles">Train Song</span>  
(Vashti Bunyan/Alastair Clayre&copy;MCPS)

Travelling north, travelling north to find you  
Train wheels beating, the wind in my eyes  
Don't even know what I'll find when I get to you  
Call out your name love, don't be surprised

It's so many miles and so long since I've met you  
Don't even know what I'll find when I get to you  
But suddenly now, I know where I belong  
It's many hundred miles but it won't be long

What will I do if there's someone with you  
Maybe someone you've always known  
How do I know I can come and give to you  
Love with no warning and find you alone

It's so many miles and so long since I've met you  
Don't even know what I'll find when I get to you  
But suddenly now, I know where I belong  
It's many hundred miles and it won't be long

## Love Song

<span class="lyrictitles">Love Song</span>  
(Bunyan &copy; MCPS 1966)

I love your eyes when you look away  
Thinking somewhere else of what ought to be  
When they're suddenly blue for a moment of time  
Then the colour goes when you look at me

I love your hands as a part of you  
As they write a word just by staying still  
When you talk they move, painting what you say  
So I understand more than words can tell

I love your hair in the dark it's soft  
In the light it moves, red and green are brown  
All the time it takes for a night to pass  
And a lifetime grows as the day comes down

I love you now as you don't love me  
I can't let you know you're too far away  
But I wonder now just what did you see  
When you looked at me in that loveless way

## Winter is Blue

<span class="lyrictitles">Winter is Blue</span>  
(Bunyan &copy; MCPS) 1966

Winter is blue  
Living is gone  
Some are just sleeping  
In spring they'll go on  
Our love is dead  
Nothing but crying  
Love will not find even  
One more new morning

Why must I stay here  
Rain comes I'm sitting here  
Watching love moving  
Away into yesterday

Winter is blue  
Everything's leaving  
Fires are now burning  
And life has reason  
I am alone  
Waiting for nothing  
If my heart freezes  
I won't feel the breaking

Why must I stay here  
Rain comes I'm sitting here  
Watching love moving  
Away into yesterday

## Coldest Night of the Year

![waiting for me](/static/images/jadd/waiting4me.jpg "Drawing by Whyn Lewis 1999")

<span class="lyrictitles">Coldest Night of the Year  </span> (Mann/Weill)</p>
<p>Baby baby it's late and you'd better go,  
it's after three  
Honey please have a heart, just look at that snow,  
take pity on me.  
I can hear that north wind blowing,  
and the fire is oh so warm  
Well I know you should be going,  
but how can I send you out in that storm  </p>
<p>Baby its cold out there, and it's getting colder  
Baby it's cold out there, getting colder  
Matter of fact better cuddle up here  
It's the coldest night of the year  </p>
<p>Baby baby I know if you wanted to,  
you'd brave the snow  
But I haven't been well I might catch the flu  
or a cold in my nose  
Lets snuggle close together  
while the whole world turns to ice  
Just the victims of the weather  
Sending you home now just wouldn't be nice  </p>
<p>Baby its cold out there, and it's getting colder  
Baby it's cold out there, getting colder  
Matter of fact better cuddle up here  
It's the coldest night of the year  
Ok? Whynot..


## I'd Like To Walk Around In Your Mind

![Lots Road, London](static/images/jadd/Lots_Road.jpg "Photograph &copy; Robert Hewison 1967")

(Bunyan 1967 &copy; MCPS)

I'd like to walk around in your mind someday  
I'd like to walk all over the things you say to me

I'd like to run and jump on your solitude  
I'd like to rearrange your attitude to me

You say you just want peace and to never hurt anyone  
You see the end before the beginning has ever begun

I would disturb your easy tranquillity  
I'd turn away the sad impossibility of your smile

I'd sit there in the sun of the things I like about you  
I'd sing my songs and find out just what they mean to you

But most of all I'd like you to be unaware  
Then I'd just wander away, trailing palm leaves behind me  
So you don't even know I've been there.


## Diamond Day

![](/static/images/jadd/jjbjps.jpg "Painting by Jenny Richardson 1972")

(Vashti Bunyan &copy; Warlock Music Ltd)

Just another diamond day  
Just a blade of grass  
Just another bale of hay  
And the horses pass.

Just another field to plough  
Just a grain of wheat  
Just a sack of seed to sow  
And the children eat.

Just another life to live  
Just a word to say  
Just another love to give  
And a diamond day


## Lily Pond

<span class="lyrictitles">Lily Pond</span>  
(Vashti Bunyan &copy; Warlock Music Ltd)

In a lily pond I lay  
all upon a summer's day  
Then I chased a dragonfly  
all across an ancient sky  
Falling with a thousand stars down the Milky Way to Mars  
Back again in time for day  
In a lily pond I lay

And the only thing he said to me  
Was- 'young lady I love thee'

## Timothy Grub

<span class="lyrictitles">Timothy Grub</span>  
(Vashti Bunyan &copy; Warlock Music Ltd)

Maurice Snail and Timothy Grub,  
Swanney and Blue and Emily Grub  
Decided one day to go into the wood  
And build them a house and live there if they could  
And they stayed there a while in the trees and the rain  
Till one day two Blue Men said you're all insane  
And to please not come here again

They had a green car called 'Happiness Runs'  
Friday comes and Happiness runs  
Out of petrol and everyone gets out to push  
And suddenly see through a gap in the bush  
A real caravan, just like the one in their dreams  
The gypsy doesn't want it for nowadays it seems  
His home stays in one place and gleams

He told them that he had a horse down the lane  
Saturday morning they went back again  
He showed them a shed that was built out of tin  
He opened the door and they all peered within  
And there lying on straw was a horse black as night  
With a star on her forehead and eyes full of light  
And they all fell in love at first sight

They thought and they thought about having Black Bess  
Timothy planted some mustard and cress  
They lived in a cupboard and made it their home  
And lay there and dreamed of the days when they'd roam  
Up and down all the hills of the North countryside  
With the dogs eating buttercups on the wayside  
And they'd wave all the cities 'goodbye'

## Where I Like To Stand

<span class="lyrictitles">Where I Like To Stand</span>  
(words John James/music Vashti Bunyan &copy; Warlock Music Ltd)

The hound bays the sheep graze I'm counting the boats in the bay  
As they float they seem to say-'I'm counting the waves, I'm counting the waves'  
The men in the boats they wave to their wives and say  
'I'm counting the hours, counting the hours, counting the hours in the day'

I'm counting the gulls that sit on the waves Surrounding the boats in the bay  
I'm counting the miles till we're there Where the sun and the rain and the snow  
Fall on the seeds and make them grow  
Fall on the rocks and make them crack into pebbles and into sand  
Which is where I like to stand

## Swallow Song

<span class="lyrictitles">Swallow Song</span>  
(Vashti Bunyan &copy; Warlock Music Ltd)

And there's a sunset brimming over the sky  
And there's a swallow teaching it's young how to fly  
Up on high  
See how fast the summer passes by

And there's an oak leaf turning green into brown  
And there's a pine so proud of her evergreen gown  
Looking down  
See how fast the winter comes around

And there's a rain cloud passing over our heads  
And there's a cat on the doorstep waiting to be fed  
Milk and bread  
Day is done and now it's time for bed

## Window Over The Bay

<span class="lyrictitles">Window Over The Bay</span>  
(words Robert Lewis/music Vashti Bunyan  
&copy; Warlock Music Ltd)

I wish I had a window over the bay  
And a black horse grazing on the green all day  
I wish I had a well to draw my water from  
And a warm log fire for when the summer is gone

I wish I had a window over the bay  
And a flock of white sheep to watch from where I lay  
I wish I had a little boat bobbing on the deep  
And a big wooden table all laid out for tea

I wish I had a window over the bay  
And a dreamy eyed cow to fill my milking pail  
I wish I had a cockerel to raise me at dawn  
And a little bed to sleep in when the curtains are drawn

## Rose Hip November

<span class="lyrictitles">Rose Hip November</span>  
(Vashti Bunyan &copy; Warlock Music Ltd)  

Rose hip November - autumn I'll remember  
Gold landing at our door, catch one leaf and fortune will surround you evermore  

Pine tree very tall, waiting for snow to fall  
Mist hangs very still, caught by dawn in castle moats around the sleeping hill  

Now a pipe is heard happy is the shepherd  
shepherdess and dog, father of the pastureland and mother of the flock  

Rosehip November - autumn I'll remember  
Gold landing at our door, catch one Leif and fortune will surround you  
Evermore  
evermore  
evermore

## Come wind Come rain

<span class="lyrictitles">Come wind Come rain</span>  
(Vashti Bunyan &copy; Warlock Music Ltd)

Come wind come rain we're off again,  
Our muddy boots plod down the lane  
The snow has snowed now the grass has growed  
And it's time that we were on the road.

Hey ho the wind and the rain  
The passers by wave their arms and grin

Come wind come rain we're off again  
Our muddy boots plod down the lane  
The mare is shod the miles untrod  
Between us and the 'land of god'..

We're on our way and everyday  
Is another ten miles and an armful of hay  
Hey ho the wind and the rain  
Another ten miles and a bucket of grain.

## Hebridean Sun

<span class="lyrictitles">Hebridean Sun</span>  
(words Robert Lewis/music Vashti Bunyan  
&copy; Warlock Music Ltd)

Travelling towards a Hebridean sun  
To build a white tower in our heads begun

The grass knows, the hills know, we all know  
Spring has come, the good fountain flows.

Each hoof fall brings us nearer the land  
Of peat and seabirds and silver sand.

The grass knows, the hills know, we all know  
Spring has come, the good fountain flows.

## Rainbow River

<span class="lyrictitles">Rainbow River</span>  
(Vashti Bunyan &copy; Warlock Music Ltd)

The rainbow river is a laughing stream  
Down in a valley by a mountain that is pine tree tall  
The rainbow river has a small boy fishing with a worm  
And a jam jar by the waterfall  
Don't make a sound don't disturb the ground  
The biggest fish you ever saw is around  
And the rainbow river gives a rainbow fish  
As one small boy goes running proudly to his mother's call

The stonebuilt farmhouse is a rough stone cottage  
Hiding close against the hillside up a winding track  
The stonebuilt farmhouse has a fair-haired farmer  
Wearing wooden shoes and building up a new haystack  
Run in the door stand on the stone floor  
The oven opens- there's the biggest loaf you ever saw  
And the stonebuilt farmhouse gives a good warm welcome  
As he sits down in his own chair with a Windsor back

The magpie meadow is a glowing evening colour  
Sun is setting quietly and the boy is tired  
The magpie meadow has a sparrow hawk who hovers  
Hanging on the wind preying eagle eyed  
Sit by the lantern watch as the years turn  
Slowly bringing truth for every child to learn  
And the magpie meadow darkens gently blue now  
As the family sit their faces lit by ember fire

## Trawlerman's Song

<span class="lyrictitles">Trawlerman's Song</span>  
(words Robert Lewis/ music Vashti Bunyan  
&copy; Warlock Music Ltd)  

I love coming home from far across the sea  
I pick my little wee wifey up  
and set her on my knee  
See how my eldest boy has grown  
whilst I've been away  
See here's a boat I've whittled for thee,  
especially for thee  
I've thought of you everyday  

I love coming home from far across the sea  
And taking up my walking cane  
and passing through the trees.  
I wander on the hillside,  
the doggie at my heel,  
The bracken waves a welcome to me  
'where have you been  
we've missed you a great deal'  

I love coming home from far across the sea  
I pick my little wee wifey up  
and set her on my knee

## Jog Along Bess

<img height="292" width="225" src="static/images/jadd/linds.jpg" alt="linds" title="Painting by Lindsay Cook 1972" />

(Vashti Bunyan&copy; Warlock Music Ltd)

Jog along Bess hop along May  
Squeak along Blue it's a walk along day  
It's a long road and weary are we  
Bubble on kettle and make us all some tea

Once there was a gypsy man  
Selling flowers from a baker's van  
Bess she pulled him round the town  
Pulled her wagon all old and brown  
Till one day we took her away  
Painted her wagon bright and gay  
Now she finds she's travelling  
North No more wandering back and forth

Once there was an Afghan hound  
Loved by no one and pushed around  
Tied up in a stable yard  
Tangled and timid and howling hard  
Till one day we took her away  
Called her Magog shortened to May  
She hurt a paw made it sore  
Now she runs on three legs instead of four

There lived a dog in London Town  
With one ear up and the other ear down  
The neighbours said he mustn't bark  
The only grass he knew was in Hyde Park  
Till one day we took him away  
Now Blue bounces through fields of hay  
But he sits and squeals like a squeaky wheel  
When the wheels are rolling that's how he feels

Little green wagon in a deep blue sky  
Wheels like dandelions passing by  
With a picture by Sam a painting by John  
And a bonnie black hoss to lead you along  
Lucky green wagon you were raggedy brown  
Now there is red at the hem of your gown  
We brought you a pumpkin brought you a mouse  
We wished very hard and you gave us a house  

Jog along Bess hop along May  
Squeak along Blue it's a walk along day  
It's a long road and weary are we  
Bubble on kettle and make us all some tea

## Iris's Song For Us

![ben](static/images/jadd/ben.jpg "Drawing by Robert Lewis 1986")

words Iris Macfarlane/music Wally Dix  
(version 2- music Vashti Bunyan)  
&copy; Warlock Music Ltd/MCPS

I climbed the peaks of glass with you  
And walked a world of brass with you  
And gladly left the glaring streets  
To share a bed of grass with you

You made the elder burn for me  
And cut the bird filled thorn for me  
And through the ripening summer days  
You bade the white road turn for me

Lock up the lark love  
And pin back the sky  
We need a space in which to work  
And sing and die

I rode the dark green deep with you  
And drove our dreams like sheep with you  
And now my love please let me cross  
Brown boundaries of sleep with you
