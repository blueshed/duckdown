## Some Things Just Stick In Your Mind

![train song jr](/static/images/things/train song jr.jpg)

Some Things Just Stick In Your Mind (Jagger/Richard)

Why does the sky turn grey every night  
Sun rise again in time  
Why do you think of the first love you had  
Somethings just stick in your mind  

Why does the rain fall down on the earth  
Why do the clouds keep crying  
Why do you sleep curled up like a child  
Some things just stick in your mind  

Why when the children grow up and leave  
Still remember their nursery rhymes  
Why must there be so much hate in their lives  
Some things just stick in their minds  



## I Want To Be Alone


I Want To Be Alone  (Bunyan)

You know there are times when I don&rsquo;t need you  
But you seem to think it means  
I don&rsquo;t love you &ndash; but I do  
But sometimes I want to be alone  
Somewhere on my own  

I don&rsquo;t know why it is but I sometimes feel  
That I have to get away  
Yet I know I love you  
But sometimes I have to be alone  
Somewhere on my own  

Don&rsquo;t make me stay to walk aimlessly  
Hand in hand &ndash; just today set me free  
Let me be alone  

Tomorrow I may find that I can&rsquo;t go through  
Even one more lonely hour  
Without you - yet it&rsquo;s true  
That sometimes I have to be alone  
Somewhere on my own  
Let me be alone  



## Train song


Train song  (Bunyan-Clayre)

Travelling north, travelling north to find you  
Train wheels beating, the wind in my eyes  
Don&rsquo;t even know what I&rsquo;ll find when I get to you  
Call out your name love, don&rsquo;t be surprised  

It&rsquo;s so many miles and so long since I&rsquo;ve met you  
Don&rsquo;t even know what I&rsquo;ll find when I get to you  
But suddenly now I now where I belong  
It&rsquo;s many hundred miles and it won&rsquo;t be long  
It won&rsquo;t be long, it won&rsquo;t be long, it won&rsquo;t be long  

Nothing at all in my head to say to you  
Only the beat of the train I&rsquo;m on  
Nothing I&rsquo;ve learnt all my life on the way to you  
Only our love that&rsquo;s over and gone  

It&rsquo;s so many miles and so long since I&rsquo;ve met you  
Don&rsquo;t even know what I&rsquo;ll find when I get to you  
But suddenly now I know where I belong  
It&rsquo;s many hundred miles and it won&rsquo;t be long  



## Love Song


Love Song  (Bunyan)

I love your eyes when you look away  
Thinking somewhere else of what ought to be  
When they&rsquo;re suddenly blue for a moment of time  
Then the colour goes when you look at me  

I love your hands as a part of you  
As they write a word just by staying still  
When you talk they move painting what you say  
And I understand more than words can Tell  

I love your hair &ndash; in the dark it&rsquo;s soft,  
In the light it moves &ndash; red and green are brown  
All the time it takes for a night to pass  
And a lifetime grows as the day comes down  

I love you now as you don&rsquo;t love me
I can&rsquo;t let you know &ndash; you&rsquo;re too far away  
But I wonder now just what did you see  
When you looked at me in that loveless way  



## Winter Is Blue


Winter Is Blue  (Bunyan)

Winter is blue living is gone  
Some are just sleeping, in spring they&rsquo;ll go on  
Our love is dead, nothing but crying  
Love will not find even one more new morning  

Why must I stay here, rain comes I&rsquo;m sitting here  
Watching love moving away into yesterday  

Winter is blue, everything&rsquo;s leaving  
Fires are now burning and life has no reason  
I am alone waiting for nothing  
If my heart freezes I won&rsquo;t feel the breaking  

Why must I stay here, rain comes I&rsquo;m sitting here  
Watching love moving away into yesterday  



## Coldest Night Of The Year


Coldest Night Of The Year  (Mann-Weill)

Baby baby it&rsquo;s late and you&rsquo;d better go - it&rsquo;s after three  
Honey please have a heart just look at that snow have pity on me  

I can feel that north wind blowing and the fire is oh so warm  
Well I know you should be going but how can I send you out in that storm  

Baby it&rsquo;s cold out there &ndash; and it&rsquo;s getting colder  
Baby it&rsquo;s cold out there getting colder  
Matter of fact better cuddle up here - it&rsquo;s the coldest night of the year  


Baby baby I know if you wanted to - you&rsquo;d brave the snow  
But I haven&rsquo;t been well I might catch the flu or a cold in my nose  

Let&rsquo;s snuggle close together while the whole world turns to ice  
Just the victims of the weather sending you home now just wouldn&rsquo;t be nice  

Baby it&rsquo;s cold out there &ndash; and it&rsquo;s getting colder  
Baby it&rsquo;s cold out there getting colder  
Matter of fact better cuddle up here - it&rsquo;s the coldest night of the year  

Ok? Why not&hellip;.  



## I'd Like To Walk Around In Your Mind


I'd Like To Walk Around In Your Mind (Bunyan)

I&rsquo;d like to walk around in your mind someday  
I&rsquo;d like to walk all over the things you say to me  

I&rsquo;d like to run and jump on your solitude  
I&rsquo;d like to re-arrange your attitude to me  

You say you just want peace and to never hurt anyone  
You see the end before the beginning has ever begun  

I would disturb your easy tranquillity  
I&rsquo;d turn away the sad impossibility of your smile  

I&rsquo;d sit there in the sun of the things I like about you  
I&rsquo;d sing my songs and find out just what they mean to you  

But most of all I&rsquo;d like you to be unaware  
Then I&rsquo;d just wander away  
Trailing palm-leaves behind me  
So you don&rsquo;t even know that I&rsquo;ve been there  



## If In Winter (100 Lovers)


If In Winter (100 Lovers)  (Bunyan-Clayre)

If in winter he should change and leave me  
I'd let him go and learn to do without him  
Oh I'd have a hundred lovers and my heart would not be broken  
And all the lies he's spoken I'd whisper to the others  

Oh it's winter now and he has changed and left me  
I let him go and now I am without him  
I don't want a hundred lovers and my heart it is so broken  
And all the lies he's spoken I whisper to myself  



## Girl's Song In Winter


Girl's Song In Winter  (Bunyan-Clayre)

There was a man when I was young  
He lived a year with me  
But the year was up and that song was sung  
And his wish was to be free  
His wish was to be free  

I was in love when I was young  
And I&rsquo;ve not been free again  
That&rsquo;s a promised fruit when you&rsquo;ve first begun  
That ripens into pain  

I had a child when I was young  
The last gift that man gave  
I wish that he could hold his son  
And the snow in the air lie on my grave  
The snow lie on my grave  



## Wishwanderer


Wishwanderer  (Bunyan)

You ask me where I live  
Don&rsquo;t you know I live here now  
But where is my one real home  
This minute with you now  
Home is where I stayed last night  
Tomorrow&rsquo;s anywhere  
If you let me stay with you tonight  
Tomorrow&rsquo;s home will be here  

Home has been so many roads  
That I walk down in my sleeping  
Here with you I&rsquo;m home at last  
But it&rsquo;s not home for my keeping  
You won&rsquo;t miss me when I&rsquo;m gone  
This isn&rsquo;t my place  
And my loves are few and don&rsquo;t belong  
To any one lover&rsquo;s face  

So don&rsquo;t ask me where I&rsquo;ll go  
If you do I will lie to you  
But I&rsquo;ll tell you of the place that is never my home  
Where I&rsquo;ve lived all my life  
Where I sing  
A wishwanderer&rsquo;s song  
A wishwanderer&rsquo;s song  
A wishwanderer&rsquo;s song  



## Don't Believe


Don't Believe  (Bunyan)

You say that you'll always love me  
That you'll never leave me blue  
Don't you know that that's all fallacy  
Don't you know it's not true  

You may want the love they talk about  
But it isn't like they say  
You will find that come tomorrow  
You won't feel this way  

When you say that you're in love with me  
Do you really know what you mean  
Or are you saying it because you've heard of it  
Or because of something you've seen  

Oh don't believe that love brings happiness  
Gone tomorrow here today  
Love involves so much unhappiness  
Don't believe what they say  



## Seventeen Pink Sugar Elephants


Seventeen Pink Sugar Elephants  (Bunyan-Jenny Lewis)

I saw seventeen pink sugar elephants  
Sitting under a chestnut tree  
I said good morning pink sugar elephants  
But they wouldn&rsquo;t speak to me  

Each had two eyes but they couldn&rsquo;t see me there  
Each had four legs but they couldn&rsquo;t go anywhere  
And so we just sat  
That early autumn morning  
Sun not yet risen and magic everywhere  

I walked up to one pink sugar elephant  
Asked why wouldn&rsquo;t he speak to me  
But he was a factory-made pink sugar elephant  
Given to children for treats after tea  

He had two eyes but he couldn&rsquo;t see me there  
He had four legs but he couldn&rsquo;t go anywhere  
And so we just sat  
That early autumn morning  
Sun not yet risen and magic everywhere  

(This for John who always wanted a third verse)  

Why would I ever think an elephant  
Made of sugar would speak to me?  
But what were seventeen pink sugar elephants  
Doing under a chestnut tree?  


## I won't say

I won't say (Bunyan) (On limited edition only)  

I won&rsquo;t say come with me everywhere I go  
I won&rsquo;t say where are you please I&rsquo;ve got to know  
You&rsquo;ve got your life and I&rsquo;ve got mine  
I&rsquo;ve got no right to call you mine  
When I know you can&rsquo;t give your life to me  

I won&rsquo;t say please love me every single day  
I won&rsquo;t try to stop your freedom in any way  
I&rsquo;ve got my life and You&rsquo;ve got yours  
I didn&rsquo;t realise this beforen ow I know  
You can&rsquo;t give your life to me  

And you can&rsquo;t say you will love me forever  
Say you will leave me never  
If I don&rsquo;t know what tomorrow will bring  
I can&rsquo;t ask you for everything  

I won&rsquo;t say come with me everywhere I go  
I won&rsquo;t say come with me please I&rsquo;ve got to know  
You&rsquo;ve got your life and I&rsquo;ve got mine  
I&rsquo;ve got no right to call you mine  
When I know you can&rsquo;t give your life to me

## Autumn Tears

![gered mankowitz 65](/static/images/things/gered mankowitz 65.jpg)

Autumn Tears (Bunyan)

In the morning when I walk along  
And it's been raining all night  
It seems the rain is all the tears that I cried last night  

When I walk along through autumn leaves  
That must have fallen last night  
It seems the leaves are all the tears that I cried at night  

If he doesn't come back soon  
The streets will never be dry  
If he doesn't come back - the road-sweeper  
Will never clear away my tears  

And I know I just won't sleep tonight  
I'll watch the rain and hear the wind  
Blowing all my tears down to the street  



## Leave Me


Leave Me (Bunyan)

When you said you would leave I thought that I would die  
I thought I couldn't live anymore if you weren't here by my side  
But now go, and leave me I don't care anymore  
I don't care if I never see you no more  

I'll always think of you  
And of the love we knew  
But I don't care anymore  

When you said you would leave me I didn't know what to do  
I couldn't face the thought of living my life without you  
But now go, and leave me  
I don't care anymore  
I don't care if I never see you no more  

I'll always think of you and of the love we knew  
But I don't care any more, I don't care anymore, I don't care anymore  



## How Do I Know


How Do I Know (Bunyan)

How do I know that those mountains aren't cardboard  
How do I know that the world is round  
Why should I know just because you've told me  
There's molten rock underneath my ground  

How do I know there's a god in the sky  
Looking down and hearing me  
Why should you say I can't love any man  
Have his children and still be free  

Go on voting, striking and fighting  
Go on searching, hiding and laughing  

I can't change you I can't even try  
But let me live like I think I can  
Then when it's time for me to say goodbye  
I'll have lived just a part of man  

Go on voting, striking and fighting  
Go on searching, hiding and laughing  

I can't change you I can't even try  
But let me live like I think I can  
Then when it's time for me to simply die  
I'll have lived just a part of man  



## Find My Heart Again


Find My Heart Again (Bunyan)

Ever since you said goodbye I haven't known what to do cos  
I haven't wanted to try to find myself someone new cos  
I just want to be with you  
How can I give myself to somebody else yet  
So I'll just stay alone  
Until I get over you and the love we knew  
And I find my heart again  

I know it wouldn't be fair to try to love someone new cos  
I'd only want you to be there and make believe he was you cos  
I I just want to be with you  
How can I give myself to somebody else yet  
So I'll just stay alone  
Until I get over you and the love we knew  
And I find my heart again  



## Go Before the Dawn


Go Before the Dawn (Bunyan)

Go before the dawn starts a breaking  
And my eyes show the sun how much I cried  
Go before my arms start their aching  
To have you once again right by my side  

The more you stay the more you remind me  
My love for you was never meant to be  
Let me leave these memories behind me  
So I can let my loneliness go free  

Thought I'd never want to be apart from you  
But all I ever got was a broken heart from you  

Oh go on your way I'll forget you  
Don't lie to me through one more hurting day  
I'll believe I never even met you  
I know we'll both be happier that way  



## I Don't Know What Love Is


I Don't Know What Love Is (Bunyan)

I don't know what love is, I can't say  
What it is that makes me feel this way  
But when I look at you it's then I know  
That I could follow you wherever you go  

Oh I don't know what love i but it seems  
That every night you creep into my dreams  
Then comes bright new morning and in my heart  
I know it's one day closer to when we will part  

But then you come  
And then I know  
That I won't ever want you to go  

Oh I don't know what love is, I never will  
But when you're gone from me I know I'll still  
Want you to be with me and wonder why  
There never was a love for you and I  



## Love You Now


Love You Now (Bunyan)

I don't say I'll love you forever baby  
I don't say I'll love you forever  
But I know that I love you now  

Dunno what tomorrow will bring baby  
Dunno what tomorrow will bring  
But I hope it can be like now  

When you're near me  
I want it to stay that way  
But if a new dawn breaks  
Please understand baby  

I can't say I'll love you forever  
Though I want to love you forever  
I can only say that I love you now  



## I know


I know (Maude)

Don't tell me you're going away I know  
And don't say what you're going to say I know  

Don't expect me to cry  
Don't even say goodbye  
And don't say life's like that you know I know  

And don't tell me I'm just a kid I know  
And how you loved the things we did I know  

Don't say that it's a shame  
And that life's just a game  
Just pack your case  
And turn your face and go  

For I am not the same when you're not with me  
Take away the bank and I will flow  

And don't tell me that flowers must die I know  
And that the cup runs dry sometimes I know  

But I have drunk my fill  
And quite fulfilled my will  
And now there's nothing left to spill or show  

Oh darlin I am not the same without you  
You just light the fuse and I will blow  

All you have to do my love &ndash; is go  



## Someday


Someday (Bunyan)

I love you, you love me  
but somehow we're not happy  
so it seems if we don't part  
we'll stay in love unhappy  

but if I leave you and you leave me  
we'll start to want eachother  
and we'll think back to the love we had  
and we'll think of it as happy  

so it will go on  
till the day we realise  
that love needn't always mean happiness  

so - think of all the time to come  
other things can make us happy  
and with no illusions our love will live  
and someday, someday, someday we'll be happy
